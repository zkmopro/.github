## What is Mopro?

Mopro is a toolkit for ZK app development on mobile. Mopro makes client-side proving on mobile simple.

It offers the following features:

-   Directly imports and executes **any Rust crate**.
-   Exports bindings for **iOS (Swift)** and **Android (Kotlin)**.
-   Generates **WebAssembly (WASM)** with Rayon for browser compatibility.
-   Provides project templates for
    -   **[Swift in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)**
    -   **[Kotlin in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/kotlin)**
    -   **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)**
    -   **[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)**
    -   **Web development**
